{"problem_name": "Classical Mechanics in Symplectic Geometry", "problem_statement": "Explain to a mathematician why symplectic geometry is the correct setting for classical mechanics.", "problem_attachment": "", "category": "6b", "standard_solution": "Source: https://cohn.mit.edu/symplectic/\n\nMy goal is to give a precise formulation of the idea of the phase space of a system in classical mechanics. This space is supposed to be a manifold with some additional structure. The points correspond to states of the system, and the additional structure is essentially the laws of motion. The dynamics of the system will be determined by a function on the manifold called the Hamiltonian (it gives the energy of each state of the system).\n\nThe fundamental example to keep in mind is n particles in three-dimensional space, acted on by some force depending on their relative positions. The phase space is (R6)n, since each particle is specified by six coordinates: three position coordinates and three momentum coordinates. The additional structure is supposed to correspond to Newton's laws (this idea will be made more precise below). The dynamics are determined from the potential function for the force, i.e. the Hamiltonian.\n\nIn more general settings there is no reason why the underlying manifold should be Euclidean space. For example, particles may be constrained to lie on curves or surfaces, or the states may not even be described in terms of a bunch of particles. It's natural to ask how abstractly this can be set up. Can we axiomatize the properties of phase space, and then just deal with it abstractly (without worrying about the precise setup that led to it)? In fact we can, and symplectic manifolds are the appropriate abstraction. In what follows I'll attempt to explain where symplectic manifolds come from. Whenever I write \"should,\" I am indicating an intuitive argument.\n\nSuppose M is a smooth manifold. What additional structure is needed to define dynamics on M? We want to turn a Hamiltonian H (i.e., any smooth function on M) into a vector field V. Then the dynamics consists of the flow along integral curves of V.\n\nFirst, note that the vector field V should depend only on the differential dH. This makes perfect sense, since the dynamics should depend only on how the energy is changing locally, and not for example on a global additive constant.\n\nSecond, V should depend linearly on dH. This amounts to the assertion that Newton's laws are linear differential equations, which is true.\n\nWhat sort of object turns a 1-form dH into a vector field V in this way? The most natural such object is a tensor field, in particular a section of Hom(T*M,TM). Here TM denotes the tangent bundle of M and T*M denotes the cotangent bundle. It will actually be more convenient to use the dual approach, namely Hom(TM,T*M), which is of course the same as T*M ⊗ T*M. It works as follows:\n\nLet ω be a section of T*M ⊗ T*M. Over each point of M, ω is a bilinear mapping from pairs to vectors to the field R of real numbers. The 1-form dH gives us a covector at each point, and the vector field V should be such that plugging it into ω gives dH. More precisely, for each vector field X, ω(V,X) = (dH)(X).\n\nOur first requirement is that ω must be nondegenerate, so we can always solve for V. Specifically, we require that for every 1-form ν on M, there is a vector field V such that ω(V,X) = ν(X) for all vector fields X. (It follows from linear algebra that V is always unique if it always exists.)\n\nSo far we've got a manifold M with a nondegenerate tensor field ω in T*M ⊗ T*M. However, not every such tensor field will do, since we really haven't used much information about the laws of physics yet. The next restriction is conservation of energy. Under which conditions on ω does conservation of energy hold?\n\nWhat it means in our situation is that the Hamiltonian H is constant along the flow lines of our vector field V. In other words, (dH)(V) = 0. In terms of ω, that means ω(V,V)=0. This must hold for all vector fields V coming from Hamiltonians, which means that the bilinear form above each point of M must be an alternating form. (Not every vector field comes from a Hamiltonian, but each tangent vector occurs in some Hamiltonian vector field.) In other words, ω is a differential 2-form on M.\n\nA symplectic manifold is a manifold together with a closed, nondegenerate 2-form. We have seen that the 2-form corresponds to having laws of physics given by linear differential equations that conserve energy, and nondegeneracy is needed to ensure that the equations have solutions. All that remains is to explain why ω should be closed, i.e., why dω = 0. Unfortunately I don't see how to explain that without slightly more notation, but it won't be too bad.\n\nThis requirement corresponds to a slightly more subtle issue, namely that the laws of physics should not depend on time. Let F_t denote the time-t flow along the vector field corresponding to some Hamiltonian H. One natural way to get the laws of physics at time t is to look at the pullback {F_t}_*ω. We want it to equal ω. Clearly it does so at time 0, so to check that it always does we simply differentiate with respect to t, as follows.\n\nIf V is the vector field corresponding to H, then the derivative of {F_t}_*ω with respect to t is {F_t}_*L_Vω, where L_V denotes the Lie derivative with respect to V. Let i_V denote the interior product with V, so for example dH = i_Vω. Then L_V ω = i_V(dω) + d(i_Vω) = i_V(dω) + d(dH) = i_V(dω) (because d^2 = 0). The requirement that ω be closed means that L_Vω = 0. Then {F_t}_*ω does not depend on t, so it always equals ω, as desired.\n\nI've swept one tiny issue under the rug. One might wonder why this setup seems to be using first-order differential equations when Newton's laws are typically stated as second-order equations. That just amounts to the usual trick of replacing a second-order differential equation in terms of position with a pair of first-order equations in terms of position and velocity (here, momentum).", "rubric": "1.

This is equivalent to the problem.\n\nAs each interval is bounded, we need an infinite number of intervals $I_n = [a_n,b_n]$ to cover the real line.  Now consider the set\n\n$$E := \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty \\{a_n,b_n\\}$$\n\nconsisting of the endpoints of the intervals $I_n$.  Clearly, $E$ is countably infinite.  Also, as the $I_n$ form a disjoint cover of $\\mathbb{R}$, $E$ is the complement of the open set $\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty (a_n,b_n)$ and is hence closed.  Finally, we claim that $E$ is perfect: that not only is $E$ closed, but every point in $E$ is a limit point in $E$.  Indeed, if $x$ lies in $E$, then $x$ is either the left or right endpoint of an interval $I_n$, but it is not both.  If it is, say, the right-endpoint of an interval, then by approaching $x$ from the right we see that $x$ is the limit of the left endpoint of intervals to the right of $x$.\n\nNow we appeal to a general theorem (a special case of the even more general Baire category theorem) that asserts that a perfect subset of a complete metric space cannot be countably infinite.  A proof is as follows.  Suppose for contradiction that $E = \\{ x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots\\}$ is a countably infinite perfect set.  Let $B_1$ be any closed ball of positive radius whose centre lies in E (e.g. one can take the closed ball of radius $1$ centered at $x_1$).  Using the fact that $x_1$ is a limit point, one can then find a closed ball $B_2$ inside $B_1$ whose centre still lies in $E$, but which is disjoint from $x_1$, and whose radius is at most half that of $B_1$.   (Indeed, if $x_1$ does not already lie in the interior of $B_1$, one simply has to shrink $B_1$ by a little bit and recenter to another element of $E$ to move $x_1$ off the boundary of $B_1$; otherwise, one uses the limit point property to find another point in the interior of $B_1$ other than $x_1$, and makes a small closed ball around that.)  Then one can find a closed ball $B_3$ inside $B_2$ of radius at most half that of $B_2$ whose centre still lies in  $E$, but is now also disjoint from $x_2$ in addition to $x_1$.  Continuing in this fashion we find a sequence $B_1, B_2, B_3, \\ldots$ of nested closed balls with radii going to zero, each of which has centre in $E$.  The centres of these balls then form a Cauchy sequence, which by completeness, must converge to a limit in $E$ that also lies in $\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty B_n$.

It is defined from the potential by subtracting the minimal possible value of $H$ for the given boundary data and halving:\n$$\nM_D^{\\alpha}(x_1,\\dots,x_{2n}) := \\inf_{\\gamma\\in X_\\alpha} H_D(\\gamma),\\qquad\nI_D^{\\alpha}(\\gamma) := \\tfrac12\\Big(H_D(\\gamma)-M_D^{\\alpha}(x_1,\\dots,x_{2n})\\Big)\\ge 0.\n$$\nHence $H$ encodes both the individual chord energies and their interaction, while $I$ is the normalized, non-negative rate function. Moreover, the minimal potential admits a semiclassical interpretation:\n$$\n-\\lim_{\\kappa\\to0^+}\\,\\kappa\\,\\log Z_{\\alpha}(D;x_1,\\dots,x_{2n})\n=\\tfrac12\\,M_D^{\\alpha}(x_1,\\dots,x_{2n}),\n$$\nso that $U:=\\tfrac12 M_D^{\\alpha}$ acts as a Hamilton–Jacobi potential for the system.\n\n3. Deterministic limit of multiple chordal SLE\n\n* **Large deviations and limit shape.** The laws of multichordal $\\mathrm{SLE}_\\kappa$ satisfy a strong LDP with good rate function $I_D^{\\alpha}$. As $\\kappa\\to0^+$, the random multichords converge (in probability, in the Hausdorff topology) to the unique minimizer of $H_D$ in $X_\\alpha$—a geodesic multichord.\n\n* **Rational function description.** In the upper half-plane with marked points $x_1<\\dots<x_{2n}$, each minimizer/geodesic multichord is the real locus of a real rational function of degree $n+1$ with critical points $\\{x_1,\\dots,x_{2n}\\}$. This ensures uniqueness (one for each link pattern) and ties the limit to real enumerative geometry (Shapiro’s conjecture).\n\n* **Deterministic dynamics and PDE.** Writing $U=\\tfrac12 M_D^{\\alpha}$, the driving function $W_t$ of the minimizing chord solves\n$$\n\\dot W_t = -\\,\\partial_{a_j}U(V_1(t),\\dots,W_t,\\dots,V_{2n}(t)),\n\\qquad \\dot V_i(t)=\\tfrac{2}{V_i(t)-W_t},\n$$\nand $U$ satisfies the system of quadratic first-order PDEs that arise as the $c\\to-\\infty$ (semiclassical) limit of the level-two BPZ equations. These encode the deterministic hydrodynamics of the $\\kappa\\to0$ limit.\n\nIn summary, the Loewner potential $H$ is the global conformally covariant functional whose minimizers describe the deterministic shapes emerging in the small-$\\kappa$ limit; the Loewner energy $I$ is the corresponding non-negative rate function governing fluctuations around them.\n", "model_score": 4, "evaluation": "The precise form of the null vector equations in item 2 is incorrect.

Although many species exhibit a 1:1 sex ratio at birth, other species deviate from an even sex ratio. This is called adaptive sex ratio variation. For example, the temperature of the nest incubating eggs of the American alligator influences the sex ratios at birth.\n\nThe role of lampreys is complex. In some lake habitats, they are seen as parasites with a significant impact on the ecosystem, whereas lampreys are also a food source in some regions of the world, such as Scandinavia, the Baltics, and for some Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest in North America.\n\nThe sex ratio of sea lampreys can vary based on external circumstances. Sea lampreys become male or female depending on how quickly they grow during the larval stage. These larval growth rates are influenced by the availability of food. In environments where food availability is low, growth rates will be lower, and the percentage of males can reach approximately 78% of the population. In environments where food is more readily available, the percentage of males has been observed to be approximately 56% of the population.\n\nWe focus on the question of sex ratios and their dependence on local conditions, specifically for sea lampreys. Sea lampreys live in lake or sea habitats and migrate up rivers to spawn. The task is to examine the advantages and disadvantages of the ability for a species to alter its sex ratio depending on resource availability. Your team should develop and examine a model to provide insights into the resulting interactions in an ecosystem.\n1. What is the impact on the larger ecological system when the population of lampreys can alter its sex ratio?\n2. What are the advantages and disadvantages to the population of lampreys?\n3.

Let the next starting position (within the 6-step period) be $s$.\n* We need to add **exactly $k$** more strikes. Write $k=15q+r$ with $r\\in\\{1,\\dots,15\\}$.\n* Take $q$ whole periods (that adds $15q$ and returns to the same start $s$), then take the **shortest prefix** (1–6 terms) from start $s$ whose sum is $r$. This exists because the “menu” of 6 prefix-sums at start $s$ covers some six distinct residues mod 15, and the process (checked once in the first few hours) lines up so that the needed $r=k\\bmod 15$ is always in the current menu.\n* Therefore we can always realize “add $k$” with at most $6$ more items (after some number of full periods), so the $k$-th block exists. Consequently $S_{n_k}=T_k$.\n\nThat’s all the clock is: it walks along the fixed 6-term wave and, at each hour, takes just enough consecutive entries to add exactly $k$. The two-period facts above ensure this is always possible.\n\n*(A nice side remark: the specific partial sums you see—1,3,6,10,13,15—are triangular numbers up to $T_4$, then $T_5-2$, then $T_5$.)*\n\n$\\#\\#$ Why this period is special, and how to generalize\n\nThe pattern you used is a **“sawtooth” of height $M=4$**:\n\n$$\n1,2,\\dots,M,\\dots,2 \\quad \\text{(period length }2M-2=6\\text{)}.\n$$\n\nIts period-sum is\n\n$$\n(1+2+\\cdots+M) + (M-1+\\cdots+2) \\;=\\; M^2-1.\n$$\n\nFor $M=4$ this equals $15$, which is the triangular number $T_5$.\n\nThis triangularity is exactly what makes the modular bookkeeping so clean. More generally, the same hourly trick works for the sawtooth of height $M$ **whenever the period-sum $M^2-1$ itself is triangular**, i.e.\n\n$$\nM^2-1=\\frac{t(t+1)}{2}\\quad\\text{for some integer }t.\n$$\n\nEquivalently,\n\n$$\n8M^2-7=(2t+1)^2,\n$$\n\nso $(2t+1,M)$ is an integer solution of the Pell-type equation\n\n$$\nx^2-8y^2=-7.\n$$\n\nThis has infinitely many solutions, giving an infinite family of valid heights $M$. The first few are\n\n$$\nM=2,\\; 4,\\; 11,\\; 64,\\; 373,\\;\\dots\n$$\n\nFor each such $M$, use the period\n\n$$\n1,2,\\dots,M,\\dots,2\n$$\n\n(length $2M-2$, sum $M^2-1=T_t$). Then the exact same induction goes through with “mod $M^2-1$” replacing “mod 15.”\n\n$\\#\\#\\#$ Other directions to play with\n\n* **Different target sequences.** We hit triangular numbers because the needed increment at hour $k$ is exactly $k$. If you want a clock whose hour-$k$ block adds some other prescribed increment $d_k$ (e.g., $k+1$, or bounded sequences), you can ask for a short periodic word whose 1–period prefix sums, taken from the current start, always offer the residue class of $d_k$ modulo the period-sum. This is a tidy finite-state/automaton design problem.\n\n* **Different “waves.”** You can try other symmetric waves (e.g., $1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2$) and check whether their period-sum is triangular. If it is, you’ll get the same phenomenon. If it isn’t, the method eventually fails (you’ll land at a start whose 1–period prefix menu does not contain the needed residue).\n\n* **Minute/quarter chimes.** If you want blocks to line up with a natural cycle (like 60 minutes), pick a sawtooth whose period-sum is $60$ (or divides it and then combine periods), and run the same residue argument.\n\n---\n\nIn short: the clock slices a fixed periodic sequence into blocks whose sums are $1,2,3,\\dots$. It works because the 6-term wave $1,2,3,4,3,2$ has period-sum $15=T_5$ and, from any start, the six prefix-sums cover exactly one representative of each residue class you will need as you move from $T_{k-1}$ to $T_k$. The same idea works for the sawtooth of any height $M$ with $M^2-1$ triangular—yielding a whole family of “triangular clocks.”\n", "model_score": 1, "evaluation": "1/2- Solution correctly identifies the pattern in the given sequence, but does not give the correct general theory of clock sequence.
